# Bookmarker

A simple bookmark manager that allows users to save, visit, and delete their favorite websites. The app stores bookmarks locally in the browser's `localStorage`, making them persistent across sessions.

### Features

- **Add Bookmarks**: Save your favorite website with a name and URL.
- **View Bookmarks**: See all saved bookmarks in a table with options to visit or delete them.
- **Validation**: Ensures that both the site name (minimum 3 characters) and URL are valid before saving.
- **LocalStorage**: Bookmarks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles for the interface (Bootstrap and custom CSS).
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and functionality (e.g., adding, visiting, and deleting bookmarks).
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for UI elements like bookmark, visit, and delete buttons.
